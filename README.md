# Actions on Google - Bible Quick Search
fw
This is a simple Google Assistant app with three features:
  - Help users do a quick search for a verse or passage without opening any apps or browser
  - Help users look up verses by a keyword
  - Displays the verse of the day

Google's Api.ai is used for designing conversation actions for the app.

# What does the service do?
It's a Bible verse search information fulfillment service that uses the [Bible.org API](https://bibles.org/pages/api).
The service packs the result in the Api.ai webhook-compatible response JSON and returns it to Api.ai.
